# User Reviews Functionality

This project is a full-stack user review system that allows authenticated users to submit reviews (ratings and comments) for various products. The system also provides editing and deletion capabilities for users and includes an admin interface for review management.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Only authenticated users can submit, edit, or delete reviews.
- **Review Submission**: Users can submit reviews with a rating (1-5 stars) and a comment for each product.
- **Edit/Delete Reviews**: Users can update or delete their own reviews. Admins have permission to manage all reviews.
- **Admin Management**: Admins can delete inappropriate reviews from the system.
- **Form Validation**: Frontend validation ensures ratings are within the 1-5 range and that comments meet length requirements.
- **Display Reviews**: Reviews are displayed with username, timestamp, rating, and comment.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios, React Icons, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (for API)
